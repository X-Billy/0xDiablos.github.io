first we will download the pic 




then i used exiftool to know what if there was the flag hidden with this pic
~# exif "Image path"


and i found nothing 
now i used strings tool to return each string of printable characters in files and i used grep too to search text or searches the given file for lines containing a match to the given strings or words
~# strings "Image path" | grep flag




yup i got the flag __flag__{*****************} and that was easy
